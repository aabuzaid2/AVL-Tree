//This project is my implementation of an AVL tree class where users can insert elements into the tree, delete elements, check (search) in the tree if an element exists, and display all elements in a tree
//The tree automatically balances whenever any change occurs with any of the following: a left turn, a right turn, a left right turn, or a right left turn
//The program faces some runtime issues related to NULL pointers which should be fixed soon

//Thanks for your time and interest
